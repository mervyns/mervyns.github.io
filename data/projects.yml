    FitNest started out as a project during my Web Development Immersive (WDI) in General Assembly Singapore. It was originally meant as a fitness and nutrition tracker app and was built on a simple framework of Express on the Back End, React-Views for the Front-End and PostGreSQL as the database.

    However, as I am a fitness enthusiast and attend (and lead) a few bootcamps regularly, I found that there was a better use for FitNest as a Bootcamp / Fitness Activity organizer. I decided to rebuild FitNest from scratch, with a new set of User Stories as well as a improved Tech Stack.

    FitNest is currently built using React/Redux on the Front-End, GraphQL as the Query Language, and MongoDB for the database. It is currently deployed in production and is being used by the various fitness groups that I join for activity tracking and planning purposes.

    friilii was conceptualized as a P2P Insurance Portal for Freelancers and those employed in the Gig Economy. This was done as my keystone project for the Web Development Immersive in General Assembly Singapore.

    As the gig economy grows, many workers do not enjoy the same health insurance benefits that traditionally employed workers have. It would also be excessively expensive for them to purchase their own insurance, as they do not enjoy the economies of scale of large corporations/MNCs.

    Hence, I decided to build a portal where people could band together and insure each other in the same way a crowdfunding or crowdsharing model works.

    Ready Up; Meet Up (RUMU) was a group project done during the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly Singapore. My fellow group members were LJ and Chris, 2 extremely talented individuals with whom I had the opportunity to work together with.

    The concept behind RUMU was basically that we wanted to find a common meeting place for groups that were located equidistant from all group members.

    We worked with the Google Maps API in order to enable this, and also leveraged on Google Maps to suggest places to meet once we have triangulated the central location. We also implemented real-time tracking and updating of travel time for each group member to get to the meeting location.

    Our key learning points from this project were about collaborative creation in a group environment, resolving merge conflicts, as well as working with Google APIs.
